**This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered application using Hugging Face's T5 model for question-answering tasks. The application allows users to upload various file types (CSV, Excel, TXT, and PDF), read the contents, and ask questions based on the uploaded content. The application then generates answers using a pre-trained T5 model.**

**Key Highlights**

***File Upload and Processing:**
  **Supports multiple file types: CSV, Excel, TXT, and PDF.
  **Reads and processes the contents of the uploaded files.
  **Filters and tokenizes text data to prepare it for question answering.

**Question-Answering with T5 Model:**
  **Utilizes the T5 model from Hugging Face for generating answers based on the provided context.
  **Prepares and tokenizes input for the T5 model.
  **Generates and returns concise answers to user queries.

**Streamlit Integration:**
  **User-friendly web interface using Streamlit.
  **Allows users to upload files and input questions.
  **Displays answers generated by the AI model in real-time.


**Detailed Function Descriptions**

**read_pdf(uploaded_file):*****
  **Reads and extracts text from a PDF file.
  **Tokenizes the extracted text and filters out unwanted patterns.
  **Returns the filtered text and a success message.
  
**read_file(uploaded_file):**
  **Determines the file type and reads the file accordingly (CSV, Excel, TXT, or PDF).
  **For CSV and Excel files, returns a DataFrame.
  **For TXT files, processes the text content and returns a DataFrame.
  **For PDF files, calls read_pdf and returns the extracted text.
  
**generate_answer(question, context):**
  **Initializes the T5 model and tokenizer.
  **Prepares the input by combining the question and context.
  **Uses the T5 model to generate an answer.
  **Returns the generated answer.
  
**truncate_context(question, context, max_tokens):**
  **Truncates the context to ensure the total number of tokens does not exceed the maximum allowed.
  **Uses the tiktoken library to count tokens and truncate the context if necessary.
  **Returns the truncated context.
  
**main():**
  **Sets up the Streamlit interface.
  **Handles file upload and reads the uploaded file using read_file.
  **Takes user input for questions.
  **Generates and displays the answer using generate_answer.
